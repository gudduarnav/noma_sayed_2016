Abstract— Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is considered as a promising downlink Multiple Access (MA) scheme for future radio access. In this paper two power allocation strategies for NOMA are proposed. The first strategy is based on channel state information experienced by NOMA users. The other strategy is based on pre-defined QoS per NOMA user. In this paper we develop mathematical models for the proposed strategies. Also we clarify the potential gains of NOMA using proposed power allocation strategies over Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA). Simulation results showed that NOMA performance using the proposed strategies achieves superior performance compared to that for OMA.  
  
Keywords— non-orthogonal multiple access; successive interference cancellation and power allocation  

    
### How to run the code?  
1. Download the code to a folder and run MATLAB.  
2. Change MATLAB current directory to the code directory named "./simulation_base/".  
3. Run the code "sys_setup".  
4. Open the files named "figure1.m" through "figure9.m" in MATLAB code editor.  
5. Go through each of these figure files and execute them with MATLAB "Run" or press "F5".  
6. The corresponding code will generate the plot and save to a ".fig" figure file of the same name.  
7. The figures generated corresponds to the same in the paper. The IEEE paper can be downloaded from the IEEE website [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7496633](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7496633) and saved to "./base/" directory. Rename the paper to "./base/base/noma_sayed_2016.pdf".
